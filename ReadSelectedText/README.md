# Read Selected Text

## What does it do?

### This accessibility-minded program uses the SAPI voice engine built into Windows with `COM` object control. It allows the user to have text read to them from the clipboard.

## How do I use it?

### Make sure you have the latest stable version of AutoHotkey installed, then run the program. Select the text which you want to be read aloud, then use the keyboard shortcut `Windows` + `S`. The selected text will be copied to the clipboard and read to you.
