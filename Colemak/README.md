# Split Screen GUI

## What does it do?

### This program remaps the keyboard to Colemak-DH Mod; one of the most efficient keyboard layouts and widely used in the ergonomic keyboard community.

## How do I use it?

### Make sure you have the latest stable version of AutoHotkey installed, then run the program. The alphanumerics will be remapped as seen in the `Colemak.ahk` file.
