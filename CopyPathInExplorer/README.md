# Split Screen GUI

## What does it do?

### This program arranges windows with an object-oriented approach of `Rectangle` and `Arrangement` objects. A set of predefined window arrangements are built (such as "TopBottomSplit", "HalfLeftQuartersRight", etc.)

## How do I use it?

### Make sure you have the latest stable version of AutoHotkey installed, then run the program. Pressing `Control` + `Alt` + `Tab` will summon the gui toward the bottom of your main screen, from which you can select the desired window arrangement. Click on each window that you want to be a part of that arrangement, and the script will move them for you. You can cancel the operation any time with the `Escape` key.
