# Line Up Columns

## What does it do?

### This program lines up the columns of all comments in Java code.

## How do I use it?

### Make sure you have the latest stable version of AutoHotkey installed, then run the program. Pressing `Control` + `Alt` + `Shift` + `L` will cut the selected text, format it, then pase it to replace your code.

### Known limitations:
- Multiline comments and block comments
- Non-monospaced fonts


#### Thanks to professor Kramer for giving me the idea to build a script.
